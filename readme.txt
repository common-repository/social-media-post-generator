Social Media Post Generator lets you create unique images of your posts to share on social media.
 
== Description ==
 
Social Media Post Generator lets you create images of your blog posts to share on social media. It automatically takes the featured image of your post and combines it with the title and some of the content.
At the moment the plugin is able to detect colors in your image and chooses the best matching one to be taken as a background for the text. Currently there are two designs which are randomly created.
* Color gets randomly selected from the image
* A good looking font pair is choosen
* Text can always be adopted
* One of the designs will be taken and randomly changed
* This Plugin dynamically loads fonts from Google-Fonts

After you generated your image you are able to download it and share it on your social media platforms.

In the near future we plan to release the following features:
* more designs (about 15)
* more customization - drag and drop lets you realign all components in the images
* saving to the wordpress media library
* creating images based on some input - so all images created with this will look the same
* a mobile app for better sharing
* and many more

**Please let us know in the comments which features from the above ones or other you'd like to see in the future**
 
== Installation ==

Just download the zip file and extract it into your plugins folder - hit install in the plugins section on your admin page and you are ready to generate! 
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How do I post these images? =
 
Generate your desired image and download it on your PC. Now send it to your mobile device and post it - it's easy as that.
In the future we are planning to create a mobile app which lets you generate these images directly on your phone and post them.
 
= Sometimes fonts do not load correctly =
 
That's may be the case when your browser can't load the fonts fast enough. Just wait a short moment and type something in the input field below the image.
We are currently working on a more userfriendly solution.
